# BDMM-Flow

BDMM-Flow is a [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org/) package for
performing phylodynamic inference under multi-type birth-death models.

The package is heavily inspired by and designed to be a drop-in-replacement of the [BDMM-Prime](https://github.com/tgvaughan/BDMM-Prime) package. BDMM-Flow implements the same model, but uses a flow-based representation of the model likelihood. This representation is faster for large trees and was introduced in the following paper:

Â§
This package adds additional modifications to the algorithm in order to further improve the performance.

## ðŸŒ´ Using the Package

In order to try out BDMM-Flow, add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tochsner/BDMM-Flow/main/version.xml as a third party
BEAST package repository and installing the package that appears (see [this article](https://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/) for more information).

## ðŸ”§ Building from Source

To build BDMM-Flow from source, you need to install the following dependencies:

- OpenJDK version 17 or greater
- the Apache Ant build system

Once these are installed and in your execution path, you can build the package by simply running the following command:

```sh
ant
```

## ðŸ‘‹ Acknowledgements

This package is heavily inspired by the [BDMM-Prime](https://github.com/tgvaughan/BDMM-Prime) package developed by [Tim Vaughan](https://github.com/tgvaughan). BDMM-Prime in turn is a fork of the original [BDMM package](https://github.com/denisekuehnert/bdmm) by [Denise KÃ¼hnert](https://github.com/denisekuehnert/)
and [JÃ©rÃ©mie Scire](https://github.com/jscire).

The flow algorithm was developed by Louca and Pennell in this paper:
